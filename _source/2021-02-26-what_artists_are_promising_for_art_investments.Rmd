On my data-driven "Artventure" of investing in art I started analysing data to gain insights about the art ecosystem. Therefore, I have been scraping data from a website called [ExpressoBeans](https://expressobeans.com), which is an art collector's community maintained by volunteers. It is an excellent start for public available data about art pieces.

From the website I could get gather data from over 220,000 art pieces. The data set contains different features of interest:

### Class

```{r}
include_graphics("class.jpg")
```

  
  
  
- Release Date
- Status
- Run
- Technique
- Paper
- Width
- Height
- Markings
- Artwork's name
- Artist's name
- Artist's pseudonym
- Orginal Price
- Collections
- Sold
- Six Month Average Price
- Average Price
- Lowest Price
- Highest Price
