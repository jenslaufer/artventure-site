On my data-driven "Artventure" of investing in art I started analysing data to gain insights about the art ecosystem. Therefore, I have been scraping data from a website called [ExpressoBeans](https://expressobeans.com), which is an art collector's community maintained by volunteers. It is an excellent start for public available data about art pieces.

From the website I could get gather data from over 220,000 art pieces. The data set contains different features of interest:

### Class

The class feature describes what kind of art the artwork is. There are `r numArtpieces` classes available, however about 90% are Posters, Art Prints or Original Art.



```{r wi, fig.height=3, fig.width=6}
include_graphics("class.jpg")
```
 
Around 88% of all art pieces are Posters, Print Art and Original Art. I wrote in my article [A Cost Effecti]()

  
### Release Date

I visualized the number of art pieces for different release year buckets. Almost 80% of all the art pieces were released between 1992 and 2021. Although the oldest art piece was from 1662, you can say the expressobeans data set is modern art data set.

```{r fig.height=10, fig.width=20}
data %>%
  mutate(total = n(),
         year_bucket = cut(year, 25, dig.lab = 4)) %>%
  group_by(year_bucket, total) %>%
  summarise(num = n()) %>%
  mutate(pct = round(num / total * 100, 1)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(year_bucket, num), y = num)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "steelblue") +
  
  geom_text(aes(label = "{pct}%" %>% glue()),
            vjust = -.1, size=8) +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(angle = 45)) +
  #coord_flip()
  labs(title = "Art pieces Release Date") +
  bbc_style()
```


### Status

Almost 90% of the art in the data set is official, 5% is fan art created by fans of artists, musicians,
an author or somthing similar.

```{r}
fanArt <- data %>% filter(status=="Fan Art") %>% 
  mutate(image="https://expressobeans.com/visual/IS.php?id={id}&t=md" %>% glue()) %>% 
  arrange(-average_price) %>% 
  head(1)
mostValuedFanArt <- fanArt$artwork[1]
mostValuedFanArtPrice <- fanArt$average_price[1]
mostValuedFanArtArtist <- fanArt$artist[1]
mostValuedFanArtClass <- fanArt$class[1]
mostValuedFanArtImage <- fanArt$image[1]
```
To get an idea what Fan Art is the piece "`r mostValuedFanArt`" from `r mostValuedFanArtArtist` which average selling price was $`r mostValuedFanArtPrice`.

```{r}
include_graphics(mostValuedFanArtImage)
```




```{r}
include_graphics("status.jpg")
```

### Run
### Technique

The technique is the way the art piece is created. The most common techniques are Screen Printing and Original Mixed media which are print art techniques.

```{r}
include_graphics("technique.jpg")
```

### Size


### Markings



```{r}
include_graphics("markings.jpg")
```
```{r}

```



### Artwork's name
### Artist's name
### Artist's pseudonym
### Original Price
### Collections
### Sold
### Six Month Average Price
### Average Price
### Lowest Price
### Highest Price
