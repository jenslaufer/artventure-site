On my data-driven "Artventure" on investing in art I started analyzing data to gain insights about the art ecosystem. Therefore, I have been scraping data from a website called [ExpressoBeans](https://expressobeans.com), which is an art collector's community maintained by volunteers. It is an excellent start for public available data about art pieces.

From the website I could gather data from over 220,000 art pieces. The goal of this article is to share some insights I found in an initial data analysis for my art investment.

First of all I will provide you a brief overview of the data in the data set. Then I will share with you the first deeper insights for my art investment.

### Brief overview about the Expressobean data set

Like I mentioned before, the data set contains information of 228,000 art pieces. Each art piece is by the following features:

- released: The date when the art piece was released
- class: The type of art piece. E.g. "Poster", "Print Art", "Toy"
- run

#### What kind of art pieces does the data set contain?

I tried to answer from two perspectives. What features hold for each art piece.




### Are limited edition really a good way to invest in art?


In my article ["A cost-effective way to invest in art"](@todo) I mentioned limited edition as interesting way of investment.  I got the insight from doing a quick research. To profe, that it's really an approach I want to prove it with the help of the scraped data.
