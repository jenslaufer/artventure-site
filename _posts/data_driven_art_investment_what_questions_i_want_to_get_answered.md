# Art Investing: What questions I want to get answers for

## The answers I want to find in a data-driven way with data from the internet

Two weeks ago I started my "Artventure" of investing in art. During this time I wrote one article Why I invest in Art this year. During my first research I found a cost-effective way of investing in art with limited editions. Besides writing I was scraping data to get data to find answers and get insights.

As a data analyst you write down the questions you the questions you want to get answers before you digg in the data. Otherwise you get lost. This is exactly what I want to do in this article.

### What artists do I like?

My goal is to invest only invest in art, that I really like. You might ask yourself how I can answer this questions with the help of data.

First of all I collect data from different artworks. I want to develop an application that let me rate the artpieces without knowing the artist. After ranking different artworks, I want to find out which artist I like.a

### How can I rank the potential artists?

I want to rank the artists I like to find out their potential. As I am not an art professional so I data-based metric for this.

Different metrics are interesting like followers on Instagram, price history of art pieces, number of searces on search engines.

### Is it realistic to get artworks from well-known artists for an affordable price?

My goal is to spend between $500-$2000 per piece to not invest in just one piece to diversify my art investments. This amounts are unrealistic if I would buy a piece with only one single copy which is common for e.g. for paintings.

To tackle this problem I want to invest in pieces from Limited Editions, which are a cost-effective way to invest in art, because there is more than one copy of an artwork, that count as an original art. The copies are signed by the artist and numbered. They are common in printmaking, photography and sculpture casting.

However, I must still find out if I it realistic to get pieces for that price. To find the answer I want to analyse pricing data.

### Is it realistic to get artwork directly from the artists?

My goal is to build up a personal relationship with artist to get on their waiting lists. I am not sure if these approach is naive.

To answer the question I want to collect addresses of personal websites of artists.

### What influences the price of an artwork?

what influences the price? technique, runs, size etc.

### How is art correlated to other asset classes?
